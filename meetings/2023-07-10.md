## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Improve developer experience for v8 performance related flags [#43407](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43407)
  * This is an issue that started in 2022 and is related to the flags that we use to build Node.js
  * Let’s keep the item in the agenda for now (visibility)
  * Currently this topic is open for community contributions

### nodejs/performance

* What's new for the Node.js Performances? - 2023 version [#98](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/98)
  * The team can publish news in this issue that are later on collected for a Node.js global activity feed in https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-news-feeder
  * This is a global initiative in the organization
  * Removed from the agenda and discussion going offline
  * This issue will be pinned in the repository
* Reduce URL initializations in ESM [#92](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/92)
  * It was part of a long process from last month (3 PRs to remove unnecessary urls and parsing content)
  * Open to contributions to finalize the last part of it
* Improve the performance of package json reader [#91](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/91)
  * Node.js is traversing folders (up to two or three levels) looking for package.json, this is slow
  * There are two PRs already merged authored by Yagiz related to parsing.
  * There is a new benchmark to measure this change (https://github.com/lemire/simdjson_performance_demo) and simdjson library proves that the overhead of reading package json lies in V8 not in Node.js
  * There is an independent problem (loading problem) that is related with v8 and not by simdjson
  * we can discuss with the v8 team regarding json deserialize/serialize potential improvements. This will require some benchmarking to explain the scenario and the potential improvements
  * This is currently open for community contributions
  * This improvement is related to startup, require and json manipulation. This will have a great impact in the community
* Fast path for `--no-deprecation` [#90](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/90)
  * I think we need a benchmark to show the change of removing deprecations and see the impact of it. The current benchmark shows 1 star confidence, which doesn’t show any improvement.
  * Ruben: I don’t think it’s worth the change, because the code is already optimized as well.
* Performance of WHATWG ReadableStream.read() [#82](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/82)
* Expensive `isTraceHTTPEnable` [#81](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/81)
  * There was a consensus that the change recommended in this pull request is not worth the performance impact due to adding the extra-overhead and code complexity.
* MakeCallback is very slow [#24](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/24)
