## Agenda

## Announcements

- Ada is backported to Node 18!
- Node 20 will include off-thread loading of modules pull request, and Ada v2.0 which will improve the URL parsing performance
- @khafradev added V8 Fast API to URL.canParse which improves the performance up to 60-70%.
- Performance became a strategic initiative of Node.js with @anonrig as the champion

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/performance

* Session proposals for the next Collaborator Summit - what should we submit [#64](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/64)
  * Three main topics suggested: web streams, benchmark CI/CD and HTTP (parser, Ada)
  * @anonrig can prepara a session about Ada
  * Benchmark main topic can be focused around the ownership/responsibilities (Build team or performance team) for the node-benchmark repository. @Ulises will try to help on this
  * Additional ideas: Introducing v8 fast API to collaborators will help to make adoption easier
  * The issue will be open, so other members can add more ideas in the following days
  * The discussion will continue offline as well
* add/remove handlers are slow on EventTarget [#60](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/60)
  * No big changes since the last meeting.
  * Removing it from the agenda until someone grabs it.
* Bun & Deno Comparison [#55](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/55)
  * @anonrig will open a pull request to move anonrig/node-benchmarks to nodejs/performance repository.
  * It will helps us to understand where we can improve
* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
  * @anonrig: Benchmarks on Undici are quite flaky. It’s quite hard to understand any performance improvement, and I propose we improve the benchmarks.


## Q&A, Other

* Path modules can leverage a performance boost. @anonrig will open an issue in the next couple of days of what we can do.
* @anonrig asked @ronag if he could automatically add Yagiz’s username to TSC notes to get notified by the meetings to share the strategic initiative news.
* Legacy CJS performance issue is open at the repository. If anybody wants to work on it, @anonrig is happy to share his knowledge on this.
