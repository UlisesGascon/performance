## Agenda

*Extracted from **performance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/performance

* Improve legacy CJS resolve [#73](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/73)
  * Nodejs is performing several c++ calls to `new URL` when running `fileExists` that can be simplified into a single C++ call.
  * This issue is open to contribution from the community. 

* MakeCallback is very slow [#24](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/24)
  * C++ is calling JS, this is very slow due Async hooks.
  * This scenario happened in the past in other parts of Node.js
  * There is a path to explore: flag to control async hooks. That way we can avoid async hook when they are not needed.
  * We want to involve more relevant contributors in this issue. We will ping them in the issue 
* fetch [#11](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/11)
  * There are no news
  * Readable streams should be the focus from now on: https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/82
  * PR from Debadree related to this: https://github.com/anonrig/node-benchmarks/pull/3


## Q&A, Other

* Expensive `isTraceHTTPEnable` [#81](https://github.com/nodejs/performance/issues/81)
